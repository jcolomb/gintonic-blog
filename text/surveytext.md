Questions:

Intro.

We have developed a folder structure template for research projects, and are eager to get the feedback of researchers of different disciplines, in order to optimize it. This version of the template was created with neuroscience projects in mind, and designed to be used in combination with a git-based data management platform, like GIN (g-node infrastructure) or GitLab. Its use would thrive an homogenization of file organization, which we think will ease data management and facilitate research collaboration. Please have a look at the template and respond to this few questions.

Please refer to BLOGPOST-LINK for more information.

![Fig.4: Folder structure developed after analyzing the survey. The template works mostly on the project level (one unique folder for all files related to one project). The experiment level is taken care by specifying several experiment sub-folders when new experiments are started. By sharing specific subfolder independently in a cloud solution, one can reorganize information in cross-project directories that host sub-folders coming from different projects. Note that both the creation of experiment sub-folders and the creation of laboratory level organization is automated in GIN-tonic.](../50_figures/pulication_ready_figures/fig4.png)



1. What is your research field?
   - Life sciences
   - Other STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths)
   - SSH (Social science, art and humanities)


2. Would you consider using this template structure for your projects?

   - yes
   - yes but would modify some elements (please specify in the next question)
   - no
    

3. Do you have any suggestions for improving the current template structure?

- COMMENT BOX

4. Will you try to implement this template structure with your collaborators?

    - I am the PI and I will force it as much as I can.
    - I will show it to everyone and try to convince them.
    - I will just use it for my projects.
    - other


5. Are you familiar with github, gitlab, bitbucket or another git-based platform?

   - using it
   - knowing it
   - nope

6. How would you like to implement the template use?  

*(NB: tonic implements functions to (1) create repositories from the template, with predefined sharing options for your lab "organization", and (2) create folders for each experiment. It is still in development.*

    - I want to download a .zip files and start from there.
    - I want to use gin-tonic to handle my repositories.
    - I would like to use tonic functions, without using gin (using gitlab instead, for example).
    
    
    
7. Please insert your email if you would like to be notified about gin-tonic milestone achievements (no more than once a semester).
